        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        
<h4>1457-1869</h4>
Main article: Edo
Tokyo began as a small fishing village named Edo. Edo was in the old Musashi Province.[7]

The Edo clan built walls to protect the town in the late 12th century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu made Edo his base. He became shogun in 1603, and the town became the center of his military government. This marked the beginning of the Edo period. During this time, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world. More than one million people lived there by the 18th century.[8]

Edo was not the capital of Japan. The emperor lived in the capital, Kyoto. However, since the shogun was more powerful than the emperor throughout Japanese history, Edo had more power.[9] After about 263 years, the Meiji Restoration removed the shogun from power. In 1869, the 17-year-old Emperor Meiji moved to Edo. The old Edo Castle became the Kokyo, the Imperial Palace.<br>

<h4>1869-1943</h4>
Main article: Tokyo, Tokyo
The Tokyo Prefecture and the city of Tokyo were established. This was the capital city until 1943. <br></p>

<h4>1943-PRESENT</h4>
In 1943, Tokyo City and the "associated municipalities of what was formerly Tokyo Prefecture (東京府, Tōkyō-fu) (1869-1943)" combined into one.

Central Tokyo is built around major railway stations. Suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level. There are some expressways.

Tokyo suffered two major catastrophes in the 20th century. The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake left 140,000 dead or missing.[10] World War II was the other disaster for the city. The Bombing of Tokyo from 1944 through 1945 killed between 75,000 and 200,000 people and destroyed half the city. This was almost as much damage as the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.[11]

Tokyo was completely rebuilt after the war. The 1964 Summer Olympics were a major world event. New high-rise developments such as Sunshine 60 started in the 1970s.
